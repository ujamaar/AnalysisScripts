AnalysisScripts
===============

These scripts are for analyzing the behavior and imaging data from our virtual reality experiments.

The behavior data are obtained in their raw form (.csv files with rows and columns of various variables that we monitor during the experiment).

However, the imaging data that we use here has already been highly processed. We don't handle any actual images at this stage. That's done mostly using the microscope imaging software and Matlab.
